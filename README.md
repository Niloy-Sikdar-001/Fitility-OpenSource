Following is the structure of the number of files/screens in the app.

## main.dart :
returns the splashscreen and the named routes

## icons/fitility_icons.dart :
 this page has the list of custom icons which are not available in flutter.
 

## screens/login.dart :
 Self explanatory, again, a page where a user can login themselves into the app either by email-password combo or by Google Sign in
 
 ## screens/onboarding.dart :
 This screen will appear when the user installs the app for the very first time. You can also call this one time intro screen.
