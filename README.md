# Fitility

A Flutter application for dance and fitness training.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

Following is the structure of the number of files/screens in the app.

## main.dart :
returns the splashscreen and the named routes

## icons/fitility_icons.dart :
 This page has the list of custom icons which are not available in flutter but we'll need it in our application.
 

## screens/login.dart :
 Self explanatory, again, a page where a user can login themselves into the app either by email-password combo or by Google Sign in

 ## screens/onboarding.dart :
 This screen will appear when the user installs the app for the very first time. You can also call this one time intro screen.
